## What I learned?

- ### Styled Components
  This website was created to learn how to use Styled Components.
  While creating the application, the CSS code was easily manageable, using styled-components allowed to eliminate the problem related to class naming. I also like the ability to reuse comopnents anywhere in the application by importing.
- ### Firebase
  Form on the wesite is handled by Firebase. The use of this tool was very easy to implement. A few lines of code is enough for messages from the form to reach me immediately.
